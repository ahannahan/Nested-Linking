    <h2><b><u>Mount Khuiten</u></b></h2>
    <p><strong>Khüiten Peak (Mongolian: Хүйтэн оргил, romanized: Hüiten orgil, [ˈxʉe̯tʰɘ̆ŋ ˈœrɟɘɮ]; lit. "cold peak"), also known in China as Friendship Peak (Chinese: 友谊峰; pinyin: Yǒuyì Fēng), is the highest peak with 4,356 m above sea level and a permanent snow cap in the Altai Range, the international border between China and Mongolia runs across its summit point. It is also the highest point of Mongolia and Altay Prefecture in Western China.

        In the past, Khüiten Peak was officially known in Mongolia as the "Friendship Peak" (Mongolian: Найрамдал Уул, romanized: Nairamdal Uul, [ˈnæe̯ɾəmd̥əɮ ˈʊːɮ]).[4]
        
        Khüiten Peak is one of five peaks of Tavan Bogd. Another peak, which is about 2.5 km north of it, marks the border tripoint between Russia, Mongolia, and China; the name of that peak is given in international agreements and on maps as Tavan Bogd Peak (Russian: Таван-Богдо-Ула, Tavan-Bogdo-Ula; Mongolian: Таван Богд Уул, Tawan Bogd Uul), or Mount Kuitun (Chinese: 奎屯山; pinyin: Kuítún shān).[5][6][7]
        
        Some sources, however, associate the name Nairamdal Peak (Friendship Peak) with the peak at the border tripoint.[citation needed]
        
        The first known ascent of Khüiten Peak was in 1963 by Mongolian mountaineers sponsored by the government</strong></p>
